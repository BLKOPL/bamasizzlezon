Bamazon is an CLI app; it is an Amazon-like storefront that uses a MySQL database and node.js. The app will take in orders from customers and alternatively remove stock from the store's inventory.

Users can engage the app as a customer, a supervisor and a manager so as to execute different functions within the app.
